Below will be the Personas portion of the site, which is to represent the personas as 2 seperate test cases for whom this site will be geared towards, and to be used as a template for the gauging of marketing content, collaterol, and representation.
	<br>
	<h2>Male Persona #1:</h2>
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Name: Jonny Eberle</h63>
	<br><img class="persona" src="images/Jonny.jpg" alt="Persona Example Jonny"> </a>
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Job Title:</h3> Foriegn Consultant
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold"> Responsibilities:</h3> Reporting on Foreign matters, both political and militarily for government and private orgranizations
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold"> Demographics:</h3> 47 years old, no formal education, however has been in the military since he was 18, recently getting out 2 years ago with a U.S Government style retirement plan, which isn't that good to be honest. He's a causcasian, divorced, recently has been dating as much as he can as he feels the tugs of traditional American family archetypes on his heart and mind. By visiting the site,  what he's trying to accomplish is seeing if making a cake in a crock pot is actually in fact romantic and tasty, for an up-coming date. He's seen small viral videos about making a cake in a crock pot, however he'd like to see how easy and what the clean might look like. He's a fairly in shape man, however with time and the ever increasing amount of time he spends at his desk typing, his boddy is starting to sag in all the wrong places. As a highly intelligent and semi-social individual, which was required for Special Forces selection and placement into foreign regimes for toppling, he feels his strongsuit are his travels into other countries and his experiences in life. He is also highly skilled with modern markup and mathematical algorthyms on a computational scale from being a vet during the late 90's when technology started to escalate, so the government poured funding into him perfecting mathematics and logarythymic tones and queues. He is a highly meticulous man with regards to how he is presented towards anyone. While his personal arrays are in an unimaginely tangled mess behind closet and bedroom doors, the areas in which he plans to entertains his guests and dates are meticulously swept and very kept. His plans for using this site are to gauge whether this cake would be a good decision for his date, given that it is the laziest way to make a cake, he is extremely interested.
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Quote:</h63> If this chocolate cake isn't good, I'm probably going to die single.

	<br>
	<h2>Female Persona #1:</h2>
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Name: Jenna Martinez</h3>
	<br><img class="persona" src="images/jenna.jpg" alt="Persona Example Jenna"> </a>
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Job Title:</h3> Unemployed at the moment, working on it, okay?
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Responsibilities:</h3> Getting married to make her mom happy, and probably finishing up school one of these days.
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold"> Demographics:</h3> Shes a Multi-racial 24 year old female who enjoys cooking in her freetime, and shes very interested in this receipe for sherbet that calls for use of a frozen concentrate can of Raspberry lemonade. She is unmarried, not really looking around. She's fairly fit, but age and metabolism have been her friend so far, however she loves sweets, therefore the effects will be advancing the older she becomes. She's hoping to graduate from her local community college, in 2 years she's booked 12 credits, so it's gonna be awhile. If ever. Her apartment where she lives with a friend from high school is fairly clean, aside from during the occasional party that they throw. She's been on a phone plan provided by her parents for the last 8 years, and she has a very basic netbook, from the age of when netbooks were thought to be "The Next Big Thing". It's an essentially useless laptop by today's standards, and can barely render a tradional webpage. She uses it only for word processing for school during the occasional document that is due. So, she uses her iPhone which her father graciously upgrades every 2 years for her to the newest device. Mostly she is looking at the site out of boredom, and is just scrolling through. Essentially displayed on Google analytics as a bounce as she skips throughout the site trying to find what she needs.
