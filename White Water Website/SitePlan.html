	<h2>Site Name:</h2> Salmon River Adventures
	</div>
	<div>
	<h2>Purpose Statement:</h2> The Purpose of this website is to address the "Salmon River Adventures" business by attracting new customers by providing information and details about their services. Another indirect effect of having a website to to create the ability to communicate with customers about new specials, to offer adventure packages, assist with decision making of customers alleviating the phone lines of unnesscessary traffic of nasic questions, and to have thw ability to offer upsell products. By creating a company approved online image and identity, we can also ensure that any semblance of Salmon River Adventures, is content and brand congruent with their company's image.

	<div>
	<h2>Target Audience Description:</h2> This site and business is geared for both tourists and die-hard outdoor enthusiasts.  Obviously we will not be servicing the individuals who are so inveloped into the sport so as to purchase all their own equipment, thus eliminating the need for a business altogether, however they may be in need of a tour guide who will facilitate the user's understanding of the way the river runs, and what pitfalls to avoid, or inversely; which areas to frequent due to the unique nature of the Salmon River. 
	<br>
	Primarily, this site will be focused on individuals looking for a rafting or outdoor experience in Idaho. They can service individuals who may be in other states, or perhaps locals looking to do something new and fun. Demographically, we'll want to target those who are in good health so as to avoid liability, and death when a canoe or water vehicle invariably tips. Swimming, while not 100% prudent due to lifevests, should be mandatory in case of emergency. QUalifying our customers to ensure that they are our target audience and will enjoy the experience and subsequently leave positive feedback online, will be crucial towards success for Salmon River Adventures. Scouting groups, and other outdoor oriented youth groups would be a great target for marketing and development.

	<h2>Personas:</h2> 
	<str>Male Persona & Scenario 1</str> <i>Warren Johnson:</i>
	<p>Warren is a man's man of about the age of 32, who loves to get out and do fun new stuff. He's looking for some new adventures while he's staying in  Idaho for a Tax Software Conference. While his desk job is very stifling, it affords him the ability to travel across the states, and occasionally internationally. He doesn't like to stay stuffed up in his hotel, so he ventures out, and checks out the loca scenery. Our target market will be towards people like Warren who are young and virile, looking to get that next great adrenaline rush. While in town, he simply Google's "Things to do in Idaho" and it geo-locates him near the Salmon river adventures storefront and location. Due to up-to-date SEO practices, it suggests salmon river adentures, and he's on his way towards becoming a rafter on the "River of No Return".
	</p>
	<br>
	<str>Female Persona & Scenario 2</str> <i>Regina Torres:</i>
	<p>Regina is a mother of 5, and shes in her late 40's. Her children are typically interested in otherthings than family, like friends, social networks, and television. In a last ditch attempt to spur some family unity, she searches for things to do near Rexburg Idaho, with the intent of being out of cell phone range. Maybe then, she'll be able to connect with her teens before they head off to college, and subsequently ignore her for 4 years until they get married. Through word of mouth, she hears abotu white water afting on the Salmon river, how fun it is, and a company who offers this experience. She googles this company, stumbles across my amazing website, and books a trip during the next break from scholastic studies, and forces her husband to take the time from work. Families are a very imp-ortant demographic for this site, and we should acommodate with family focused design and feel.</p>

	<h1>Content Architecture</h1>
	<p>
	The architecture of the content will include various testimonials, in addition to some factual informaiton about the salmon river. We'll also include information about the company itself, it's history, in addition to white water rafting information, like what to wear, what to expect, rules, safety precautions, and lots of visual eye candy about the river rafting experience. Also a trip booking section is prudent, along with price lists.

	<div>
	<h1>Style Guide</h1>
	<p>
	Very soft colors, lots of pictures about rafting along with videos of previous rafting groups. We're looking to capture nature and quantify it onto a web page to ensure the viewers and potential customers that we are a reputable company, with guides who know their way around a quick moving river.
