Below will be the Audience Description, an archetypal list of subgroups whom is deemed to be test cases in which this site is geared towards. This is not to be miscontrued as a solely these subgroups of personalities, races or gender purposes for the site.
	<br>
	<h2>Gender, Ages, and personalities of Typical users:</h2>
	<br class="thinBody">The target audiences for this site are going to be generally those who enjoy cooking! Typically from previous analytics reports of sites who's sole claim to fame is cooking, or food related, the majority tend to be women between the ages of 24 to an upwards of 64. The next largest group would be women under the age of 24, followed closely by men of the ages from about 35-55. Since gathering data from users under the age of 18 is illegal under some guidelines of the DMCA, that is an unknown factor, but gathering from the analytics of those who I have inquired of, this would not be a very large percentage. The typical likes and dislikes of this user group is stereotypical, unfortunately. However, with the site being niche, meaning targeting a smaller more specific crowd of users who wish to see how recipes will actually turn out as opposed to those who just want a quick recipe which is a much larger group. The users that were trying to target are those who enjoy making an appealing meal that will be remembered, and who care about what they're going to make and won't take someone's fleeting, biased opinion on if the food actually turns out good. We also plan on diving into the nitty-gritty, so to speak, of the meal prep work, cleanup, texture and many of the other aspects that are usually overlooked when a recipe is written and shared online. These individuals will also be interested to see us use common off the shelf ingredients along with sharing where we bought them, and attempting to our best ability to keep the science of cooking and preparing the food in the most scientific manner possible.
	<br>
	<h2>Economic & Education Range</h2>
	<br class="thinBody">The typical economic range that we're attempting to appeal to is going to be varied. We have already decided to niche by making videos our primary source of media along with some print text on the site and social media pages in addition to taking a non traditional appraoch to marketing a cooking channel on the internet. So we're attempting to appeal to those in the lower class, primarily middle class, and some upper-middle class. By doing so, we'll increase the target audience as much as possible without limiting or overextending ourselves and losing viability in our already established target markets.
	<br>
	<h2>Device Targeting</h2>
	<br class="thinBody"> The device's that we're going to try and target are going to be primarily mobile and tablet media. The reason for this is that on multiple studies in addition to my professional clients that I manage, they take the majority of the view shares. In addition to easy social integration and sharing, they are going to be the focus. We'll be targeting the resolutions of the iPhone 5 series of phones, along with the standard resolution of the full size iPad. The Android archetecture is too diverse to support as many viewports, so therefore we'll be using the "em" markup and percentages in our CSS tables to hopefully scale the media in proportion with the device. For the sake of this class, we'll be building the site firstly on a standard HTML browser on a desktop, and building in functionality as we proceed down the road.
