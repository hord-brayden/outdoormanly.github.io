		<h2>Recipes Page</h2>
		<br>Content: This page will have a complete list  of all the recipes we have ever cooked & recorded broken down into three columns, entrees, recipes, and appetizers.

		<h2>Entrees Page</h2>
		<br>Content: This page will consist entirely of entrees that we have cooked and recorded. It will be a little more expansive with text due to the specific nature of the page.

	</div>
	<div id="MainBodyText">
		<h2>Request a Recipe Page</h2>
		<br>Content: This page will have some basic styling around a wsywig editor to send us messages without creating a user account. it will have a name field in addition to an email form which will auto enroll whoever requests a recipe in our email campaign so we can let them know whenever we post their recipe or whenever we post anything that they might like, due to checkboxes that theyll select which indicate which types of food theyd be interested in seeing.

		<br>Content: This page will have vendor specific information for advertisers to reach out to us to purchase advertising space on the website. I anticipate having a few 230x79 areas to sell out to bidders on a monthly basis. The fee will be dependant upon how many users we get during our first few months of traffic and if I can convince people to pay for spots
		<br>Media: Just basic contact informaiton styled in congruency with the rest of the site.

	</div>
	<div id="MainBodyText">
		<h2>Youtube Page</h2>
		<br>Content: This will be a link to a page that contains a massive lists of videos with no text. It will just be embedded youtube videos, so people that come to the site who are looking for something specifically but they forgot what it is called, they can scan this page to find it quickly.
		<br>Media: Lots of youtube embedded videos with no text. The titles are on the embedded cover picture of the youtube links. We'll keep all the videos bot on youtube and the site so we can keep user  activity on-site to a maximum.
