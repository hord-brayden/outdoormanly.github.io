<h1>Personas</h1>
	</div>
</header>

	<div id="MainBodyText">

Below will be the Personas portion of the site, which is to represent the personas as 2 seperate test cases for whom this site will be geared towards, and to be used as a template for the gauging of marketing content, collaterol, and representation.
	<br>
	<h2>Male Persona #1:</h2>
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Name: Jonny Eberle</h63>
	<br><img class="persona" src="images/Jonny.jpg" alt="Persona Example Jonny"> </a>
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Job Title:</h3> Foriegn Consultant
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold"> Responsibilities:</h3> Reporting on Foreign matters, both political and militarily for government and private orgranizations
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold"> Demographics:</h3> 47 years old, no formal education, however has been in the military since he was 18, recently getting out 2 years ago with a U.S Government style retirement plan, which isn't that good to be honest. He's a causcasian, divorced, recently has been dating as much as he can as he feels the tugs of traditional American family archetypes on his heart and mind. By visiting the site,  what he's trying to accomplish is seeing if making a cake in a crock pot is actually in fact romantic and tasty, for an up-coming date. He's seen small viral videos about making a cake in a crock pot, however he'd like to see how easy and what the clean might look like. He's a fairly in shape man, however with time and the ever increasing amount of time he spends at his desk typing, his boddy is starting to sag in all the wrong places. As a highly intelligent and semi-social individual, which was required for Special Forces selection and placement into foreign regimes for toppling, he feels his strongsuit are his travels into other countries and his experiences in life. He is also highly skilled with modern markup and mathematical algorthyms on a computational scale from being a vet during the late 90's when technology started to escalate, so the government poured funding into him perfecting mathematics and logarythymic tones and queues. He is a highly meticulous man with regards to how he is presented towards anyone. While his personal arrays are in an unimaginely tangled mess behind closet and bedroom doors, the areas in which he plans to entertains his guests and dates are meticulously swept and very kept. His plans for using this site are to gauge whether this cake would be a good decision for his date, given that it is the laziest way to make a cake, he is extremely interested.
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Quote:</h63> If this chocolate cake isn't good, I'm probably going to die single.

	<br>
	<h2>Female Persona #1:</h2>
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Name: Jenna Martinez</h3>
	<br><img class="persona" src="images/jenna.jpg" alt="Persona Example Jenna"> </a>
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Job Title:</h3> Unemployed at the moment, working on it, okay?
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Responsibilities:</h3> Getting married to make her mom happy, and probably finishing up school one of these days.
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold"> Demographics:</h3> Shes a Multi-racial 24 year old female who enjoys cooking in her freetime, and shes very interested in this receipe for sherbet that calls for use of a frozen concentrate can of Raspberry lemonade. She is unmarried, not really looking around. She's fairly fit, but age and metabolism have been her friend so far, however she loves sweets, therefore the effects will be advancing the older she becomes. She's hoping to graduate from her local community college, in 2 years she's booked 12 credits, so it's gonna be awhile. If ever. Her apartment where she lives with a friend from high school is fairly clean, aside from during the occasional party that they throw. She's been on a phone plan provided by her parents for the last 8 years, and she has a very basic netbook, from the age of when netbooks were thought to be "The Next Big Thing". It's an essentially useless laptop by today's standards, and can barely render a tradional webpage. She uses it only for word processing for school during the occasional document that is due. So, she uses her iPhone which her father graciously upgrades every 2 years for her to the newest device. Mostly she is looking at the site out of boredom, and is just scrolling through. Essentially displayed on Google analytics as a bounce as she skips throughout the site trying to find what she needs.
	<br class="thinBody"> <h3 class="bold">Quote:</h3> Hmm, this looks good.

	<h1>Audience Description</h1>
	</div>
</header>

	<div id="MainBodyText">
	<!-- fsfd
	-->
Below will be the Audience Description, an archetypal list of subgroups whom is deemed to be test cases in which this site is geared towards. This is not to be miscontrued as a solely these subgroups of personalities, races or gender purposes for the site.
	<br>
	<h2>Gender, Ages, and personalities of Typical users:</h2>
	<br class="thinBody">The target audiences for this site are going to be generally those who enjoy cooking! Typically from previous analytics reports of sites who's sole claim to fame is cooking, or food related, the majority tend to be women between the ages of 24 to an upwards of 64. The next largest group would be women under the age of 24, followed closely by men of the ages from about 35-55. Since gathering data from users under the age of 18 is illegal under some guidelines of the DMCA, that is an unknown factor, but gathering from the analytics of those who I have inquired of, this would not be a very large percentage. The typical likes and dislikes of this user group is stereotypical, unfortunately. However, with the site being niche, meaning targeting a smaller more specific crowd of users who wish to see how recipes will actually turn out as opposed to those who just want a quick recipe which is a much larger group. The users that were trying to target are those who enjoy making an appealing meal that will be remembered, and who care about what they're going to make and won't take someone's fleeting, biased opinion on if the food actually turns out good. We also plan on diving into the nitty-gritty, so to speak, of the meal prep work, cleanup, texture and many of the other aspects that are usually overlooked when a recipe is written and shared online. These individuals will also be interested to see us use common off the shelf ingredients along with sharing where we bought them, and attempting to our best ability to keep the science of cooking and preparing the food in the most scientific manner possible.
	<br>
	<h2>Economic & Education Range</h2>
	<br class="thinBody">The typical economic range that we're attempting to appeal to is going to be varied. We have already decided to niche by making videos our primary source of media along with some print text on the site and social media pages in addition to taking a non traditional appraoch to marketing a cooking channel on the internet. So we're attempting to appeal to those in the lower class, primarily middle class, and some upper-middle class. By doing so, we'll increase the target audience as much as possible without limiting or overextending ourselves and losing viability in our already established target markets.
	<br>
	<h2>Device Targeting</h2>
	<br class="thinBody"> The device's that we're going to try and target are going to be primarily mobile and tablet media. The reason for this is that on multiple studies in addition to my professional clients that I manage, they take the majority of the view shares. In addition to easy social integration and sharing, they are going to be the focus. We'll be targeting the resolutions of the iPhone 5 series of phones, along with the standard resolution of the full size iPad. The Android archetecture is too diverse to support as many viewports, so therefore we'll be using the "em" markup and percentages in our CSS tables to hopefully scale the media in proportion with the device. For the sake of this class, we'll be building the site firstly on a standard HTML browser on a desktop, and building in functionality as we proceed down the road.

	<div id="MainBodyText">
	<!-- fsfd
	-->
This page is for outlining the Color Schemes, Typography, Navigation and rough sketches of this site, it's componenets, the branding and trademarks associated therewith. Below, all of the above will be outlined in excruciating detail.
	</div>

<nav role ="navigation" id ="page-nav">
	<div  id="MainBodyText">
		<h2>Color Scheme</h2>
<div id="MainBodyText">
For the Color Scheme for BossyBecky.com, I decided to go with basic colors that contrast well against each other. Essentially gray, white, black and red. Nothing too fancy, but in its simplicity is beauty.
</div>	
<img class="logo" src="images/colorscheme.png" alt="Color Scheme for BossyBecky.com">		
	</div>
</nav>
<main>
	<div id="MainBodyText">
		<h2>Typography</h2>
		<br>For our typography focuses, we're going to be using external fonts from Google's repositories. Namely we'll be using Roboto 100 thin, 300, and 400 in addition to Open Sans 700. The links to these fonts are inside the css file. Click <a href="css/style.css">here</a> to view the css file.
	</div>
	<div id="MainBodyText">
		<h2>Navigation</h2>
		<br>For the navigation bar on the site, we're going to be using a responsive bar that is stuck to the top of the screen. It also has hover and loading properties. It is in coordinance with our fonts and color schemes. Click <a href="css/style.css">here</a> to view the css file to see the implementation of this style of navigation.
	</div>
	<div id="MainBodyText">
		<h2>Responsiveness</h2>
		<br>We plan on building out to support primary iOS devices and desktop viewports. Currently we are using the "em" designation for sizing all of the content so that it can properly scale with any size. Later we will build out specific css and redirect pages that gauge the screen px density and redirect accordingly so as to maximize our viewers experience and create a pleasurable experience on the site.
